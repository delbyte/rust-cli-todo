I need to have some sort of clock to remove the [complete] tasks from the list the next day, and maybe some sort of reminder. 
I want some cool fancy stuff on the CLI to make it look all cool and fancy
I want some functionality to start it on startup and ping the user about remaining tasks, and if none add left then tell the user to add tasks for the day.
